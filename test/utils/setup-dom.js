// Full DOM rendering with the Enzyme testing library for React (http://airbnb.io/enzyme/) is useful
// for when you have components that interact with DOM APIs or may require full lifecycle support to
// fully test the component. Full DOM rendering requires a full DOM API to be available at the
// global scope. This script sets up a full DOM API at the global scope using the jsdom library
// (https://github.com/tmpvar/jsdom).
//
// It is recommended that you load a document into the global scope *before* requrining the React
// library for the first time. This is because React makes several assumptions about the
// environment it is running in and one of them is that the 'global.document' that is found at
// "require time" is going to be the one and only document it ever needs to worry about.
//
// Note that it is important that your tests using the global DOM APIs don't have "leaky"
// side-effects which could change the results of other tests.
//
// For more info see: http://airbnb.io/enzyme/docs/guides/jsdom.html
